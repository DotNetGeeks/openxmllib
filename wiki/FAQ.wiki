== Why are we stuck with lxml 1.3.x =

Yes, I know there's a new stable version of lxml (2.0.1 at the date of wrinting). But lxml 1.3.x is enough for what we need now and some Mac users - like me - are still stuck with lxml 1.3.x today.

Anyway, after reading the code, and the doc that ships with lxml 2, openxmllib _should_ work with lxml 2.0.x.

I just need some volunteers who can run the unit tests that ship with openxmllib against lxml 2.0.x. Anyone?
